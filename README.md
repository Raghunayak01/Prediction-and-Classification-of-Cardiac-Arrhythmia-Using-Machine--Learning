Cardiac arrhythmia poses a grave threat to health, leading to significant complications if left undiagnosed or untreated. Timely identification of arrhythmias is paramount for saving lives. Arrhythmia refers to irregularities in heart rhythm, manifesting as either excessively fast or slow heartbeats. Many arrhythmias manifest without any discernible symptoms, but when they do, individuals may experience sensations like palpitations or moments of heartbeats pausing. In severe cases, symptoms can include dizziness, fainting, breathlessness, or chest discomfort. While most arrhythmias are not inherently life-threatening, some can predispose individuals to grave complications like stroke or heart failure, while others can precipitate cardiac arrest.
Arrhythmia is a widespread affliction, affecting millions globally. A significant proportion of cardiovascular-related deaths can be attributed to arrhythmias, with ventricular arrhythmias accounting for a substantial portion of sudden cardiac deaths. Although arrhythmias can affect individuals of any age, they are more prevalent among older populations. Any disruption to the heart's electrical impulses, responsible for orchestrating its rhythmic contractions, can precipitate arrhythmias. In individuals with healthy hearts, a resting heart rate typically falls within the range of 60-100 beats per minute. Physical fitness can influence resting heart rate, with highly trained athletes often exhibiting lower resting heart rates due to enhanced cardiac efficiency

 # Cardiac Arrhythmia 


Cardiac arrhythmia poses a grave threat to health, leading to significant complications if left undiagnosed or untreated. Timely identification of arrhythmias is paramount for saving lives. Arrhythmia refers to irregularities in heart rhythm, manifesting as either excessively fast or slow heartbeats. Many arrhythmias manifest without any discernible symptoms, but when they do, individuals may experience sensations like palpitations or moments of heartbeats pausing. In severe cases, symptoms can include dizziness, fainting, breathlessness, or chest discomfort. While most arrhythmias are not inherently life-threatening, some can predispose individuals to grave complications like stroke or heart failure, while others can precipitate cardiac arrest.


Arrhythmia is a widespread affliction, affecting millions globally. A significant proportion of cardiovascular-related deaths can be attributed to arrhythmias, with ventricular arrhythmias accounting for a substantial portion of sudden cardiac deaths. Although arrhythmias can affect individuals of any age, they are more prevalent among older populations. Any disruption to the heart's electrical impulses, responsible for orchestrating its rhythmic contractions, can precipitate arrhythmias. In individuals with healthy hearts, a resting heart rate typically falls within the range of 60-100 beats per minute. Physical fitness can influence resting heart rate, with highly trained athletes often exhibiting lower resting heart rates due to enhanced cardiac efficiency

# A few factors can cause the heart to work incorrectly, they include:

•alcohol abuse.
• diabetes. 
• drug abuse. 
• excessive coffee consumption. 
• heart disease like congestive heart failure. 
• hypertension (high blood pressure). 
• hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland).

# Electrocardiogram (ECG):

The heartbeat is initiated by the heart's electrical system, with each heartbeat reflected as a wave on an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). Cardiac arrhythmias encompass a spectrum of severity, ranging from mild to severe. While most arrhythmias are benign and pose little risk, some can be extremely dangerous and life-threatening. Many arrhythmias, even if not particularly harmful, can cause troublesome symptoms that disrupt daily life. The Sinoatrial Node (SA node), also known as the Sinus Node, is a small cluster of cardiac tissue responsible for generating electrical impulses that coordinate the heart's contractions. These impulses begin in the right atrium, prompting both atria to contract before reaching the atrioventricular (AV) node, which connects the atria and ventricles. The normal resting heart rate for adults typically falls between 60 to 90 beats per minute, while children tend to have higher resting heart rates. Conversely, trained athletes often exhibit lower resting heart rates.
